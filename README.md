This is a project realized by Sensible Team. This is a application for students for financial management that helps them track their incomes and expenses and learn more about how they can manage it more easily. The information they find is: individual amount per income/expenses, total amount, receipt picture, location and description.

While we were working on our Xamarin App, we decided to test other technologies. React-Native is the one we liked the most and we decided to continue implementing the features for the future.


* OCR Technology

We used Nanonets OCR API for this feature of the application. We created a new model, added 140 images of individual receipts for an accuracy of 92%,we annotate it and after we set the model to train. The result is a Json response which we are using for extracting the total-price. We have functions for the request, taking the picture, send it and extracting the maximum number from that Json response which represents the total-price.

* Map Component

We used Google Maps API for implementing the map which allows a user to provide their current location or mark one on the map. We used GeoLocation Api for displaying a real address of the chosen location. In this way, a user takes a picture of the receipt and choose location, saving this data in the database.

* Google Sign-In

Google Sign-In manages the OAuth 2.0 flow and token lifecycle, simplifying the integration with Google APIs. Before you can integrate Google Sign-In into your website, you must create a client ID, which you need to call the sign-in API.
Using Google Account to sign in to third-party sites and apps makes everything easier because you do not need to remember individual usernames and passwords for each account.
